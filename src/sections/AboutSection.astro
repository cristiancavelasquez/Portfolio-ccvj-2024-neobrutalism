          I am a Colombian Industrial Engineer, graduated from Universidad de
          los Andes, with a background in data analysis for Mazda Colombia.
          Later, I moved to the pharmaceutical sector, working as an Operations
          Analyst at Close Up. There, I saw the need to present data models in a
          more efficient and secure way, which led me to learn web development.
          Since then, I have been creating web apps to improve operations and
          client interactions, continuously learning and staying up-to-date with
          the latest technologies.
